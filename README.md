Project for Creating a Mega-Sensor in your Bedroom

Update - I have changed the micro controller. Instead of a D1 mini ESP32, I am now using a ESP32C3 Tiny Micro controller. This allows for another sensor
         to be added, the Bed Occupancy Sensor. All files in this github repository have been updated to reflect this change.
         
When Inserting components please use the front of the board as shown below. Use the number and letters on this
side of the board

Solder the board on the other side. Ignore the number and lettering scheme on the side you solder from.
